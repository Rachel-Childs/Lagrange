This almost feels like a ‘dear diary’ moment as I sit here on the couch, one beagle lying on  my foot, the other sitting behind me, and I’m contemplating how to get this bad boy started!

If you’ve visited my ‘about’ section, you’ll know I’m doing this blog as one of ‘6 commitments’ for 2015. Forget resolutions, they’re a thing of the past – commitments are where it’s at. So:

- Practice my harmonica
- Run the 50km Ultra in Taraweras – November
- Read 10 + books (last year I only made time to read 5)
- Landscape front section of my garden
- Lots of beagle time
- Write this blog

How am I going, you ask? Well clearly I’ve been so busy with 1 – 5 that I’m only getting round to 6 in mid-March but it’s happening!

The gang in a nutshell:

Winston is one of the coolest guys you’ll meet – he’s full of energy, but knows when to play it cool, he’s happy going for a training run or chilling on the couch and he knows how to have a good time.

I’m looking after a 5 1/2 year old beagle for 9 months as well, named Bentley. He is Mr laid-back – unless there’s a dental stick around, they’re too delish to resist! He has a playful side that comes out at the funniest times, and he’s become a part of  my little family.

What do I do other than tick off my commitments? I work in communications, and outside office hours try and see my gorgeous friends, relax, bake (900mm oven installed – loves it!) and ultimately – spend time with my pawesome pals.

Sniff you later,
