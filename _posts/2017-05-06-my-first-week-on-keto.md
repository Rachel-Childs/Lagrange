## My First week on Keto...

I'm at the hair dresser, waiting for my balayage to develop, sipping on my peppermint tea - with a delicious looking piece of caramel slice staring me in the face.

With any other ‘diet’, fad, or ‘new mindset’ I have tried, that treat would already be gone - all I need to do is convince myself I’ve earnt it. But this time, on ‘keto’, I can't bear the thought of eating it for fear of getting ‘out’ of Keto!

I was beyond dubious to start. As has been the general consensus from blogs I've been reading as we’re conditioned to think: Fat is bad, you need carbs for energy, go higher protein if anything. Well, after one week I'm feeling great! And I'm noticing the effects already. 

What is a ketogenic diet/state? In simple terms, getting your body to the point where you are burning fats instead of glycogen (sugars). In order to do that, you up the fat intake, have moderate protein, and drop the carbs - meaning less than 5-10% (read: goodbye bread, pasta, grains, fruit).

It might sound limiting, but in fact it's exciting and interesting to research meal options, and really it's not too different from what I would normally eat -

**Breakfast:**
Eggs, avocado, spinach

**Lunch:**
‘Burgers’ - mince meat with spinach, avocado, cheese

**Dinner:**
Chipotle pulled chicken with broccoli

I’ve made ‘bread’, some chocolate mousse, and am focusing on eating whole foods and getting my fats from a variety of sources (nuts, fish, meat, delish coffee with coconut oil…).

Week one and getting over the ‘keto flu’ - look it up, it’s a thing - feeling tired, irritable (when aren’t I?!), and headachy, I now feel fuller for longer, I’m not eating as much, and my energy levels are up. Win:Win! Additionally, the scales are looking promising, although Ketosis has a diuretic effect, meaning the water weight goes quickly (hence hydration is key)!

Will I keep up with it long term? I’m concerned about pressures from the outside world...dinner dates, brunches, Fri-yay night drinks, tracking macros. I’ve committed to trying it for two weeks, and will reassess after that - but I’m loving the effects so far.
