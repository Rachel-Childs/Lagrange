Iâ€™m a kiwi girl, with a tricoloured beagle named Winston. Iâ€™ve started this blog as part of the â€˜7 commitmentsâ€™ I set myself this year. As a way to share updates about what Iâ€™m doing but also to serve as a fabulous memory bank for all of the adventures we have- from cafes to beaches, and dog parks to trail runs!

I am an active committee member of the NSW beagle club, and love running (depending on the time of yearâ€¦walking), baking, reading and dancing! Winston is 1 year old, loves all the best things in life â€“ socks, jandals, chicken, Sunday siestas and playing.

Join Winston and I as we sniff out all our local hot spots, get up to mischief and some humble opinion pieces on what works for us while juggling our busy lifestyles â€“ the beagle world operates at a mile a minuteâ€¦as does corporate life ðŸ˜‰
